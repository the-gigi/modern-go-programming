# Foundations
	
This chapter means business. I kid you not! You will get to see all the building blocks of programming, see where Go stands on the shoulders of giants and where it decided to add its own variation on a theme. The topics we will cover are:
 
 - Naming of different entities such as files, types and variables
 - How does assignment work in Go
 - The Coolness that is Type Inference
 - Controlling the flow of your program with conditions and switching
 - Looping and Iterations
	
## Naming and Visibility

Go takes the stance that identifiers starting with a Capital letter are public (exported) and identifiers starting with a lowercase letter are private. That rule applies to constants, variables, types, functions, interfaces and what have you. Identifiers in Go can use any UTF-8 letter or digit and must start with a letter. However, public identifiers must start with an English capital letter. This breaks somewhat the internationality of Go, since English gets this privileged status regarding public identifiers.
